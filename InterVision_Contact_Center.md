## **Call Flow Process**
### **1. Customer Calls the Contact Center**
- When a customer dials the **InterVision support number**, the call is received by **Amazon Connect**.
- A Lambda function is invoked immediately to check if the customer's **mobile number exists in the loyalty database (DynamoDB)**.

### **2. Loyalty Member Check (AWS Lambda)**
- If the caller **is a loyalty member**, they are routed to the **VIP Queue**, where skilled agents handle their inquiries with priority.
- If the caller **is not a loyalty member**, they are directed to an **Amazon Lex bot** to interact with self-service options.

### **3. Interactive Self-Service (Amazon Lex)**
The **Amazon Lex bot** presents the caller with multiple options:
- ðŸ“¦ **Order Status Inquiry**
- ðŸ”„ **Returns & Refunds**
- ðŸ’³ **Payment Issues**

### **4. Handling Customer Inquiries with Lex and Lambda**
#### **Order Status Inquiry**
- The **Lex bot prompts the customer** to enter their **Order Number**.
- A second **Lambda function is invoked**, which retrieves the **order status** from **DynamoDB** and provides a response to the customer.

#### **Returns & Payment Queries**
- Customers selecting **Returns** or **Payment Issues** are routed to specialized **queues** where skilled agents assist them.
- The system ensures that customers are directed to the right support team without unnecessary delays.

### **5. Callback Feature in the Queue**
- While waiting in the **queue**, customers are given the **option to request a callback**.
- If selected, the customer provides a **callback number**, which is stored as a **task** for agents.
- Agents are notified about pending callback requests and can return the call when available.
